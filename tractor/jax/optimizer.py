    # 4. Optimize
    # Use Matrix-Free Newton-CG for linear least squares.
    # Since the problem is linear in fluxes, the loss is quadratic.
    # We solve H * delta_x = -grad using CG.

    # 1. Compute Gradient
    grad_fn = jax.grad(loss_fn)
    grads = grad_fn(initial_fluxes)

    # 2. Define Hessian-Vector Product (HVP)
    # The Hessian of f(x) is the Jacobian of grad(f)(x).
    # HVP(v) = J(grad_f)(x) * v
    # In JAX, we can use jvp to compute forward-mode derivatives.
    # jvp(fun, primals, tangents) -> (primals_out, tangents_out)
    # where tangents_out is Jacobian * tangents.

    def matvec(v):
        # We compute H*v at the initial point (any point works for quadratic/linear problem)
        # return jax.jvp(grad_fn, (initial_fluxes,), (v,))[1]

        # Alternatively, for linear least squares specifically:
        # Loss = ||Ax - b||^2
        # Grad = 2 A^T (Ax - b)
        # Hessian = 2 A^T A
        # H*v = 2 A^T (A * v)
        # We can implement this using jvp on the residual function if we exposed it.
        # But jvp on grad is generic and works.
        return jax.jvp(grad_fn, (initial_fluxes,), (v,))[1]

    # 3. Solve H * step = -grads using CG
    # jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg(A, b, x0=None, tol=1e-05, atol=0.0, maxiter=None, M=None)
    # A can be a function.

    step, info = jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg(matvec, -grads, maxiter=50) # 50 steps usually enough for convergence

    # 4. Apply Update
    # For a purely quadratic function, one Newton step is exact.
    optimized_fluxes = initial_fluxes + step

    # 5. Update Tractor object
    # Copy tractor object?
    # Or update in place.

    # We must ensure optimized_fluxes is a numpy array (cpu) before setting params
    # because tractor objects expect numpy usually.
    optimized_fluxes_np = np.array(optimized_fluxes)

    flux_idx = 0
    for src in catalog:
        n_flux = len(src.brightness.getParams())
        new_flux = optimized_fluxes_np[flux_idx : flux_idx+n_flux]
        src.brightness.setParams(new_flux)
        flux_idx += n_flux
